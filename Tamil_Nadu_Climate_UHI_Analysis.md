## 🏙️ Urban vs Rural Temperature Differences

- **Urban Avg**: 26.69 °C  
- **Rural Avg**: 26.99 °C  
- Slightly **hotter rural temperatures**, likely due to geographic positioning.

- **T-Test Result**:
  - t = -4.48, p ≈ 7.6e-6 → **Statistically significant difference**

## 📊 UHI (Urban Heat Island) Findings

- **Monthly Urban-Rural Anomaly Heatmap**:
  - Strongest in **March–May**
  - Fluctuations post-2017; highest differences over +1.5 °C observed

- **March & July UHI Trendlines**:
  - Clear anomalies every few years
  - Trendline added with LOWESS smoothing

---

## 🗺️ Spatial Mapping & Seasonal Patterns

- **Summer Avg Temperature Map**:
  - Delta and southern inland districts are hottest

- **Winter Avg Map (Cooler regions = darker)**:
  - Nilgiris and Theni consistently cold

- **Heatwave Frequency Map**:
  - South and delta regions saw most months >35 °C
  - Useful for public health risk identification

---

## 🧪 Statistical Tests Summary

- **T-Test**: Urban vs Rural temperatures are statistically different
- **ANOVA**: Seasonal variation across districts is significant
- **Mann-Kendall**: 7 districts show confirmed warming trends

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Ramanathapuram, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Virudhunagar**: High-risk zones
- **Urban areas show seasonal heating patterns**, though geography influences intensity
- Project combines geospatial mapping, time-series visualization, and statistical inference
